    "### Decorator \n",
    "A decorator is a construct that allows you to wrap a target function, define additional statements to be added before or after the wrapped function, and make it easily reusable. \n",
    "\n",
    "A decorator has the ability to run additional code before or after calling the wrapped function. This allows access to and modification of the input arguments and return values. \n",
    "\n",
    "### When is a decorator used? \n",
    "It is used when there is a main clause and you want to add additional clauses to it, or when you want to use the additional clause repeatedly. By declaring the additional work as a decorator, it can be used freely. "
